CS 143B: Project 1 - File System

Instructions:
1. Open the command prompt and run the command:  
        python3 main.py

Now the program should be running!
To run program with a file as input, and produce an output file, named output.txt:
        python3 main.py < input.txt > output.txt

Notes:
-   Some of the function parameters have slightly different names (on Piazza I   saw that this was okay), but they correspond directly to the specifications of the project and are positionally in the same order.
